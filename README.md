cct_api
=======

This is a WordPress plugin for creating a web api from within WordPress. This plugin creates a new
custom post type called API. When you create an API post, everything in the post is executed as PHP
just before the wp_head action. It will then exit so that no theme code is ran. You can access all
WordPress functions to create a web api for your site. Please see our examples tutorials at http://customct.com!
